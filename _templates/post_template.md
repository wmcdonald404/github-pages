## Overview
Outline the basic purpose of this post/page.

## Background
Dig deeper into the background, why has this been written. Possibly [include a link](href) to a documentation snippet from the upstream documents:

> Some elucidating quote from the product landing page.

Now what we're going to jump into. 

## How-to
1. Do a step

    Sub-step if this step needs multiple steps. Or sub-paragraph if some additional context is required.

    ```
    $ some shell commands
    ```

2. Another step, single simple step this time.

    ```
    $ more shell, sure to work seamlessly
    ```

3. A long step with multiple substeps and description points.

    First a thing:
    ```
    $ shell thing
    ```
    Aww yeah, another thing:
    ```
    $ more shell is less
    maybe some STDOUT for added excite!
    ```
    Even more text, when will it stop?
    ```
    PS> we're not narrow-minded
    ```

4. Wrap up with a [`GH_REPO`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_help_environment) link or something

    ```
    wmcdonald@fedora:~$ export GH_REPO='https://github.com/wmcdonald404/github-pages' 
    ```

## Summary
