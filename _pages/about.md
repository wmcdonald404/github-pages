# Tech Stuff
I started this blog earlier in the year, primarily to try and capture some of the portable/reusable pieces of tech knowledge I'd been working on.

Over the years I've learned, documented and forgotten tens, if not hundred, of bits of ***'how to do X'***. Recently, working back in hands-on tech roles I was finding myself rediscovering/relearning things I'd written down years earlier but then left behind firewalls and DLP systems in company Wikis.

So this is an effort to sanitise, anonymise and capture these things as I go.

# Cooking Stuff
I also like to cook.

I normally squirrel interesting recipes away in my mailbox with a `recipes` label but figured it might be useful again to have them more widely visible. This isn't the full repertoire but just the ones I think are worth porting over as I go.
