## Overview
While working on a project where Ubuntu was the distribution of choice, I had to map some basic RHEL/Fedora concepts to Debian/Ubuntu's package management. Inspired by the original [A Sysadmin's Unixersal Translator](https://bhami.com/rosetta.html), this was an initial effort to map concepts between distributions.

## How-to
See the [distrosetta-stone](https://github.com/wmcdonald404/distrosetta-stone?tab=readme-ov-file#distrosetta-stone) repository for more details.
