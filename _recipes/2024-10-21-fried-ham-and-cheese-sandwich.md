## Overview
Possibly up there with the best cheese & ham toasties you'll ever make.

Again from [The Good Cook](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Simon-Hopkinson/The-Good-Cook/7074398).

## Ingredients
### For the sandwich filling
- 250g/9oz gruyère cheese, grated
- 2 free-range egg yolks
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp mustard powder
- 2 pinches cayenne pepper
- dash cream (if mixture is too thick to spread)

### For the sandwich
- 4 slices thin white bread (square)
- 4 thin slices cooked ham
- olive oil

## Method
1. Put all the sandwich filling ingredients (except the cream) into a food processor and blend until smooth (the mixtuer should spread easily, but add a little cream if needed.)

2. Cover four slices of bread with a thin layer of cheese mixture almost to the edge, place a slice of ham over that and then finally place another slice of bread on to the ham. Press down firmly and then repeat the process for the second sandwich. Cut off the crusts and liberally brush (or spray) each side of the sandwiches with olive oil.

3. Cut each sandwich in half to give four rectangles. Heat a large, non-stick frying pan until medium-hot and fry the sandwiches in the dry pan until gorgeously golden-brown and crusted on each side - about two minutes per side. 

## Notes
> Gruyère works well in this ham and cheese sandwich recipe as it has a lovely melting quality, but you can use another cheese if preferred. 

Don't bother trying to fancy this up with sourdough, stick to white sandwich bread.

Some sundried tomato blended through the mixture would probably be a good variation.
