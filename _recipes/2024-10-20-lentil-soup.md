## Overview
This is a brilliant soup, it's easy, healthy and delicious. Make a big batch and have it for lunch or it should freeze well if you're a meal-prep type.


## Ingredients
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 80g/2¾oz pancetta, finely diced into 5mm/¼in pieces
- 1 large onion (about 100g/3½oz), finely chopped
- 2 carrots (about 200g/7oz), peeled and finely chopped
- 4 celery sticks (about 150g/5½oz), trimmed and finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp thyme leaves
- 1 bay leaf
- 1.5 litres/2¾ pints chicken stock
- 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 250g/9oz red lentils
- 250g/9oz (about ½ head) Chinese leaf cabbage or savoy cabbage, shredded
- large handful fresh flatleaf parsley, roughly chopped
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method
1. Heat the oil in a saucepan over a high heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, for about 2–3 minutes, or until the fat has rendered and the bacon is golden and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.

2. Add the onion and carrots to the pancetta pan and cook for 5 minutes until the onion is softened. Add the celery and garlic and cook for a further 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3. Add the thyme, bay leaf, stock and tomatoes, stir and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the lentils and cook for 20–25 minutes, or until they are softened. Remove the bay leaf and use a stick blender or food processor to partially blend the soup, keeping a fairly chunky texture.

4. Bring the soup back to a simmer, add the cabbage and cook for 3–4 minutes until wilted. Reheat the pancetta in a small frying pan at the same time.

5. Stir half of the parsley into the soup and ladle into warmed bowls. Serve immediately topped with the pancetta and remaining parsley. 

## Notes
It's soup, so obviously serve with [bread and butter](https://wmcdonald404.github.io/github-pages/recipes/2024-10-20-soda-bread-perfect.html). 

I tend to forgo the cabbage and blend until pretty smooth but that's down to personal preference.

Nisbet's sell some [massive enamel mugs](https://www.nisbets.co.uk/olympia-enamel-soup-mug-large-670ml/dc398) that are great for soups and soupy stews.
