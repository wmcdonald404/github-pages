# Overview
This Skagenröra shrimp salad is a constituent component for an 'authentic' Tunnbrödsrulle.

# Ingredients
- 400 g cooked shrimp, without shells
- 200 g crayfish tails (can use extra shrimp instead)
- 1 tbsp fresh dill
- 2 tbsp chopped chives
- 1/2 lemon
- 6 tbsp sour cream (or crème fraîche)
- 5 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp red fish roe (optional)

# Method
- Rinse the shrimp and crayfish tails and pat dry with a paper towel.
- Chop about half of the shrimp and crayfish tails into smaller bits. Set aside a handful of shrimp for garnish, if you wish.
- Chop the dill and chives and mix together with the shrimp and crayfish in a large bowl. Add the zest of about half a lemon to the mixture.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mayonnaise, and about a tablespoon of lemon juice. Set aside the other half of the lemon for garnish.
- Stir the dressing into the shrimp mixture. Add the fish roe and stir well.
