## Overview
Incredibly simple, delicous, quick balanced salad.

Again from [The Good Cook](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Simon-Hopkinson/The-Good-Cook/7074398).

## Ingredients
- 2-3 heads red and white chicory, separated into leaves, soaked in iced water for about 10 minutes
- 1 large ripe pear, peeled, thinly sliced
- 125g/4oz Roquefort (or similar blue raw milk sheepâ€™s cheese), crumbled
- squeeze lemon juice
- 2-3 tbsp walnut oil
- freshly ground black pepper

## Method
1. Dry the chicory leaves and neatly arrange onto a serving dish, inner curved sides facing upwards. Drape the pear slices over the leaves.

2. Evenly distribute the cheese in and amongst the leaves and squeeze over a touch of lemon juice.

3. Trickle over the walnut oil and grind over a little freshly ground black pepper. 

## Notes
It has a different consistency but this would probably be delicious with [Perl Las](https://www.cawscenarth.co.uk/products/organic-perl-las-mini), and many other local cheeses.

The pear already adds sweetness, but some honey, or possibly even chili honey would probably also work.
