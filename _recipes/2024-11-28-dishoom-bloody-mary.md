## Overview
I was reminded in a [recent Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/dempster2000.bsky.social/post/3lbv2zlxypk22) about the existence of [Clamato](https://www.clamato.com/en) [Juice](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/Product/clamato-tomato-cocktail-946ml) which sounds both revulsive and delicous in equal measure. That got me thinking about the Dishoom Bloody Mary which is a great prep-ahead drink for kids of all ages.

> For best results, make the Bloody Mary mix up in advance and give the flavours a few hours to mingle though the longer you leave it, the more peppery it will get. Those with foresight might decide to prepare it the night before the morning after.

> Enough ice is absolutely essential to a good Bloody Mary, so you need plenty of room in the glass, which should be filled almost to the top with ice cubes.

> The tomato purée helps the juice along a little, so there is no need to buy an expensive tomato juice. We use a smoke powder, but at home you can use smoked paprika, or replace the Tabasco with the smoked version.

I'm reproducing this from the [Dishoom cookbook]9(https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/23539713). Go buy a copy, it's a great cookbook and their [Daal Makhni](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=dishoom+dal+makhani&atb=v443-1&ia=web) OMFG.

## Ingredients
SERVES 4 (or 1)

### For the Bloody Mary mix
- 540ml tomato juice
- 65ml tomato purée
- 25ml Tabasco sauce
- 65ml Worcestershire sauce
- 40ml lemon juice
- 40ml distilled white vinegar
- 3 tsp ground pink Himalayan salt (or flaky sea salt)
- 3 tsp crushed black pepper
- 2 tsp jaggery reduction (page 339)
- ½ tsp smoked paprika

### To serve
- 100ml vodka
- Bloody Mary mix (see above)
- Ice cubes
- 4 celery sticks
- 4 pickled silverskin onions
- Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. For the Bloody Mary mix, combine all the ingredients in a jug and stir well to ensure the salt and spices are well distributed. Store in a sealed bottle or jar in the fridge and use within 4-5 days.

2. When ready to serve, add the vodka to the Bloody Mary mix, stir to combine and pour into 4 tall glasses. Add as much ice as will fit in the glass.

3. Garnish with the celery and silverskin onions and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

> **Note:** For a single serving, pour 165ml Bloody Mary mix into a glass and add 25ml vodka and plenty of ice.

## Notes
Bloody Mary is an extensively fuckabout-able recipe. Make a baseline, then tweak to your personal preference.

- I add [celery salt into the mix](https://thespiceshop.co.uk/products/celery-salt?_pos=1&_sid=b05d32c02&_ss=r) because traditionalist and all that.
- You want something like a couple of [klipit/tupperware jugs](https://www.nisbets.co.uk/sistema-klip-it-plus-2l-juice-jug/ch243) to let the mix sit for hours/overnight in the fridge.
- Peeling the celery with a speed peeler can help prevent those annoying stringy bits getting stuck in your teeth.
- You can replace/supplement the white vinegar with pickle juice from the remains of a jar of pickled onions, gherkins or similar.
- Minneapolis is famous for its [ridiculous Bloody Marys](https://discoverthecities.com/best-bloody-mary-minneapolis-st-paul-twin-cities/).
