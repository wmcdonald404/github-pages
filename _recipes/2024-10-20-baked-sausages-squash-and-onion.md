## Overview
This is a Jill Dupleix recipe from the Times on [Tuesday November 09 2004](https://www.thetimes.com/article/baked-sausages-winter-squash-and-red-onions-srjmdcwwz8z)

I've made this a bunch of times and I don't think I've ever messed with it other than volumes/proportions, I've never added anything entirely new. Maybe a splash of cider vinegar?

It's also one of the few times sweet potatoes really shine.

- **Serves:** 4
- **Prep:** 15 min 
- **Cook:** 1 hour

## Ingredients
### Tray bake
- 2 red onions
- 8 good pork sausages
- 1kg winter squash (for real flavour look for onion, gem or butternut squash)
- 2tbsp olive oil
- Sea salt and pepper
- A few sprigs of thyme
- A few sprigs of rosemary
### Tomato Sauce
- 400g tinned chopped tomatoes
- 1tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- ¼tsp dried chilli flakes
- ½tsp each of salt, sugar, oregano

## Method
Heat oven to 200C/Gas 6. Peel the onions and cut into quarters. Prick
the sausages well. Cut the squash in half and then into 2cm wedges,
discarding the seeds but not the peel. Tumble the sausages, onions and
squash into a roasting pan lined with greaseproof paper and drizzle
with olive oil. Scatter with sea salt and pepper, thyme and rosemary,
and bake for an hour, or longer if you like them crisped.

Make the tomato sauce before or after your bath: combine the chopped
tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, chilli, salt, sugar and oregano in a
small pan and simmer for 10 min until thickened. Arrange the squash,
sausages and red onions on four warmed dinner plates, spoon over the
hot tomato sauce, and tuck in a little extra fresh rosemary.
