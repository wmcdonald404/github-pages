# Overview
Back around 2010 / 2011 I did a few projects in Stockholm with Telia Sonera, Telenor and some adjacent companies.

I was aware of Tunnbrödsrulle, possibly from local recommendation, before it was [popularised more widely outside of Sweden by Bourdain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPCytfxNU7Y). They are fantastic street snacks, just the right ratio of risk/reward in terms of drunkely dropping your dinner all down your shirt.

Hotdog, mashed potato, shrimp salad, some crispy onion, ketchup & mustard, in a wrap. What's not to love.

# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp (15g) butter
- 1 onion (or [Ikea ROSTAD LÖK](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/rostad-loek-fried-onion-30237176/) or just normally crispy hotdog onions.)
- 4 hotdogs (I like Wikinger)
- 2 [lomper](https://scandinaviancookbook.com/traditional-norwegian-lomper-potato-flatbread/) or tunnbröd (or wheat tortilla)
- 180g mashed potatoes, or 1 portion of Smash, take 30g add 150ml (approx. 1/4 pint) of boiling water, mix with a fork.
- 2 tbsp (8g) parsley
- 6 tbsp (90g) Skagenröra
- ketchup and/or mustard

# Method
- Melt the butter in a frying pan and chop onion into thin slices. Add onion to the butter and cook on low heat for about 15 minutes, until golden caramel.
- Cook hotdogs however you prefer (eg. boil water and take off heat and let hot dogs cook in the hot water for about 10 minutes).
- Set lomper on two plates. Add about 4 tbsp of mashed potatoes to each lompe. Sprinkle with fresh parsley.
- Add two hotdogs on top of the mashed potatoes on each lompe.
- Add 3 tbsp of Skagenröra per plate on top of the hotdogs.
- Top with fried onions, ketchup, and/or mustard. Roll up the lomper and enjoy!
