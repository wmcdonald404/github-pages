## Overview
Another Felicity Cloake entry. Go read the full entry in [#references] for the rundown on how the recipe was developed. I've made it once and it was excellent. Simpler than many more fancypants recipes but really, really good.

- Serves 4


## Ingredients
- 350g chicken livers, cleaned
- 175g butter, diced
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 tsp thyme leaves, finely chopped
- 75ml madeira
- 75ml double cream
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 allspice berry, ground
- ¼ tsp ground ginger

## Method
1. Cut the livers into roughly 1.5cm pieces, and heat a knob of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and thyme and soften, then turn up the heat to medium-high, add the livers and saute for a couple of minutes until browned on the outside but still pink inside. Tip into a food processor.

2. Add the madeira to the pan and boil until reduced to a couple of tablespoons. Tip into the food processor, add the cream, salt and spices and whizz until smooth. Add all but 75g of the butter, and whizz again. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.

3. Pass through a sieve into a serving dish and chill for half an hour. Melt the remaining butter and pour on top, then refrigerate until set.

## Notes
Serve as per with some cornichon or other pickled things and toasted bread.
