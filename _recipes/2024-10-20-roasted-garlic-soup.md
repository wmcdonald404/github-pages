## Overview
Another absolutely delicious soup. Roasting heads of garlic whole has a similar effect to confit, resulting in delicous gentle garlic warmth, taking all the harsh garlic edge off. 

This is **not** a dish for [FODMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP)-intolerant friends. You have been warned.

## Ingredients
### For the roasted garlic
- 5 large whole heads of garlic (about 340 grams)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (about 30 ml)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (about 1.5 grams)
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (about 0.5 grams)

### For the soup
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (about 30 grams)
- 115 grams pancetta, chopped
- 2 medium leeks, well rinsed and whites only finely chopped (about 150 grams)
- 1 cup chopped yellow onions (about 160 grams)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (about 3 grams)
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper (about 0.5 grams)
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (about 1 gram)
- 1/2 cup roasted garlic (about 120 ml)
- 1/4 cup dry white wine (about 60 ml)
- 3 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock (about 830 ml)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (about 120 ml)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (about 8 grams)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (about 15 ml)

### For the crutons
- 1/2 loaf rustic Italian bread, cut into cubes (about 200 grams)
- 8 thinly sliced rounds of French bread
- 1 clove garlic, halved
- 1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese (about 120 grams)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil (about 7 ml)
- Chopped chives, garnish

## Method
### For the roasted garlic
Preheat the oven to 160째C (325째F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

Cut the top quarter from each head of garlic and place, cut side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the oil lightly over the cut garlic tops, and sprinkle with the salt and pepper.

Turn the garlic cut side down, and roast until the cloves are soft and golden brown, about 1 hour.

Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle. Squeeze each head of garlic, gently pressing with your fingers to expel the cloves into a bowl.

Stir the garlic with a rubber spatula to blend thoroughly. Use as needed, or store refrigerated in an airtight container.


> Yield: About 120 ml (1/2 cup).

### For the soup
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes.

Add the leeks, onions, salt, pepper, and thyme, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are very soft but not colored, 5 to 6 minutes.

Add the roasted garlic and stir well to incorporate. Add the white wine, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, until the wine is nearly all evaporated, about 3 minutes.

Add the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft and the soup is slightly thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.

Add cubes of bread to thicken, if desired, and then blend with an immersion blender.

Add the cream, parsley, and lemon juice and simmer for 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

### For the croutons
Preheat the oven to 200째C (400째F).

Place the sliced French bread on a baking sheet and bake on both sides until just crisp and light golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.

Remove from the oven and rub one side of each slice with the cut garlic clove.

In a small bowl, mash the cheese with the olive oil and spread 1 tablespoon of the mixture on top of each crouton.

Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

### To serve
Ladle the soup into bowls and top each serving with 2 cheese croutons. Garnish with chopped chives and serve hot.
