# Description
This is another early favourite when I was starting to learn to cook.

# Ingredients

## For the sauce
- 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
- 30g butter
- 2tsp flour
- 1 small glass of red wine
- 1tbsp tomato purée
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes or the equivalent fresh, skinned, seeded and chopped
- 500ml beef or chicken stock (a good quality cube will do)

## For the meatballs
- 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
- 1tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1tbsp vegetable oil plus extra for frying
- 400g minced pork with about 10-15 per cent fat
- 50g fresh white breadcrumbs
- A good pinch of ground cumin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Flour for dusting

# Instructions
Gently cook the onions, garlic and thyme in a little of the vegetable oil until soft. Put to one side and cool down. Mix the minced pork, breadcrumbs and cooked onions together with the cumin then season well with salt and pepper. Test the seasoning by rolling a little flat cake of the mixture and gently frying it in oil for a minute or so on each side, cool down, taste and season more if necessary. Roll the mixture into squash-ball sized pieces and refrigerate for 30-40 minutes to set.

To make the sauce, gently cook the onions and garlic in the butter until soft, add the flour, stir well then add the tomato purée and the tomatoes. Slowly add the red wine and stock, bring to the boil, lightly season with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.

Heat a little oil in a heavy frying pan, lightly dust the meatballs with flour and fry a few at a time until golden. Take out and drain on kitchen towel to remove excess fat.

Add the meatballs to the sauce – you may need to transfer everything into a larger pan. Cover the pan and simmer gently for about 30-40 minutes, giving the sauce the occasional skim. Check the seasoning and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Serve the meatballs with Parmesan polenta (follow the instructions for making soft polenta on the packet and stir in Parmesan at the end), mashed potato or spaghetti.


# Substitutions
A mix of pork and beef would be good. I'd probably use a panade now for more tender meatballs. I'd also use more of a sofrito/mirepoix with the addition of carrot & celery to the vegetable base for the sauce to bump up diversity of veg.
