# Description
This is one of the first things I learned to cook when I finally moved into a place with my own kitchen.

# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp oil
- 2 tbsp lard or butter
- 1 kg stewing steak, cubed
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 large onion, peeled, cut in half and finely sliced
- 2 carrots, peeled, cut in half lengthways and finely sliced
- 4 sticks celery, peeled and finely sliced
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small green pepper, finely sliced
- 1 tsp caraway seeds
- 1 small bunch parsley, roughly chopped
- 1 small tin peeled chopped tomatoes
- 1 bayleaf
- 1 whole dried red chilli (preferably of the Hungarian paprika type)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 small tub crème fraîche

# Instructions
Heat the oil and a tablespoon of the butter in a large, heavy-based pan, season the beef and brown it all over. Add the paprika and cook for a couple of minutes longer. Tip out the meat and any cooking juices into a clean bowl.

Add the rest of the butter to the cooking pot, along with the sliced onion, and cook over a low heat for five minutes or so, until the onion has softened and started to go translucent. Add the carrot and celery, and cook, covered, for another 10 minutes, then stir in the garlic, green pepper, caraway seeds and all but a tablespoon of the parsley. Cover, and cook for five minutes.

Tip in the tomatoes, bayleaf, whole dried chilli and a little water, return the meat and its juices to the pot, then bring to the boil. Season lightly - it's best to go easy at this stage, as you can always add more at the end - then turn down the heat to very low, whack on the lid and leave it to simmer very, very gently for a couple of hours, until the beef is really tender. Taste from time to time to see how it is doing - if at any point you think it's quite spicy enough, simply fish out the chilli for the rest of the cooking time.

Once the beef is done, add the potatoes and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until they, too, are tender. Top each serving with a spoonful of crème fraîche and some finely chopped parsley.

# Substitutions
It's endlessly adaptable but an excellent baseline. I like shin, some oxtail or shin bones to add some bone marrow would be excellent additions.
