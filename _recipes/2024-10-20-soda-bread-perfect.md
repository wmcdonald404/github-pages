## Overview
Another Felicitly Cloake ["the Perfect..."](https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect----) recipe. The easiest of all breads, incredibly quick to make and tasty, although it won't keep as well as something like a milk bread that's probably not going to be an issue.

## Ingredients
> (Makes 1 loaf)

- 450g coarse wholemeal flour
- 50g rolled oats
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 level tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tbsp treacle
- 1 tbsp honey
- 450ml buttermilk (or sour milk, or milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice)
- 1 tbsp melted butter, to finish

## Method
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and grease a baking sheet.

Once the oven has come to temperature, put all the dry ingredient into a large mixing bowl and whisk together to combine. Make a well in the middle. Stir the treacle and honey into the buttermilk until well mixed, then pour this into the well and, very quickly, stir together with your hands until you have a soft, sticky dough.

Form this into a round on your baking sheet and cut a deep cross in the dough. Bake for 50 minutes to an hour, keeping an eye on it, until the crust is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath.

Brush with melted butter and leave to cool before tearing into it. Eat as soon as possible, as it doesn't keep very well.

## Notes
[Redbournbury Organic Malted Wholegrain Flour](https://www.bakerybits.co.uk/redbournbury-organic-malted-wholegrain-flour) is great for this recipe.

The treacle is really nice in this, you could probably swap in good maple syrup instead if you don't have tracle in the cupboard.
