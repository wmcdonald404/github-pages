# Overview
Not made this one yet but planning on trying to find a really good sausage gravy recipe and this looks like a good baseline.

# Ingredients
## For the Gravy:
- 42 g bacon grease or butter , (bacon grease strongly recommended as it will produce the BEST flavor)
- 340 g bulk pork sausage, typically italian sausage in the US? ([click link](https://www.daringgourmet.com/italian-sausage-recipe/) for the BEST homemade sausage recipe!)
- 40 g finely chopped yellow onion
- 42 g all-purpose flour
- 945 ml whole milk (can substitute a portion with heavy cream of half and half for even creamier results)
- 1 cube chicken bouillon , or 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- a few dashes hot sauce for heat , optional
## For the Buttermilk Biscuits:
- 185 g all-purpose flour
- 185 g cake flour
- 16 g baking powder
- 1 g baking soda
- 12 g sugar
- 6 g salt
- 145 g plus 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into pieces

# Method
## For the Gravy: 
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break off/crumble the sausage into little pieces with your fingers and add them to the pan. Cook until no longer pink. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 5-7 minutes. Add the bacon grease and flour, stirring to combine and cook until the mixture is golden brown, 5-7 minutes.
- Add the milk gradually along with the seasonings, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes or until the sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper taste.

## For the Buttermilk Biscuits:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a food processor and process briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk all at once and pulse just until the ingredients are moistened. Donâ€™t over-pulse.
- Scrape the sides and bottom of the food processor bowl and turn out the dough onto a floured work surface. The dough will be very soft. Sprinkle the dough with a little flour and gently knead the dough a few times. Pat the dough into a loose rectangle about 1 1/2 inches thick. Fold the rectangle like a letter, overlapping the short sides in the middle to make 3 layers. Pat the dough into a rectangle 1 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut out the biscuits, pushing straight down and lifting up without twisting. Pack together the remaining scraps and cut out additional biscuits.
- Place the biscuits on the baking sheet, spaced about 1 inch apart, and bake for about 15-18 minutes, or until the biscuits are firm to the touch and the tops and bottoms are golden brown. Let them rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving with the sausage gravy. Makes 16 biscuits.

# Notes
Not sure I'd bother with cake flour, need to compare US to UK flour gluten levels.
I'd probably forgo the sugar in the biscuits too, we're making biscuits, not biscuits here.
