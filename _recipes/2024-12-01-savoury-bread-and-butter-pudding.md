## Overview
I haven't made this yet but did make something similar to use up some stale bread and ~3 days~ close to out-of-date ham.

> This is a savoury take on a classic bread and butter pudding with sausages, bacon and mushrooms for a full English breakfast cooked in one dish.

- Prep Time 10 minutes mins
- Cook Time 40 minutes mins
- Total Time 50 minutes mins
- Servings 6

## Equipment
- Large frying pan or skillet
- Large baking dish
- Sharp knife
- Wooden spoon

## Ingredients
- 12 cocktail sausages
- 6 slices white bread
- 50 g butter
- 4 slices smoked bacon back
- 1 onion
- 6 mushrooms
- 50 g cheese cheddar
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 3 eggs
- 500 ml milk
- 1 tablespoon parsley fresh, chopped
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tsp salt

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 190 C / 375 F / 170 FAN / Gas 5
2. Start by grating the cheese and peeling and slicing the onions.
3. Cut the mushrooms into quarters and cut the bacon into chunky slices.
4. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onions and sausages together over a medium heat for about 10 minutes until coloured.
5. Add the bacon pieces and mushrooms and fry for a further 5 minutes.
6. Grease the baking dish with a little oil or butter.
7. While the sausage mixture is cooking spread the bread with the butter, slice in half or quarters and arrange in the baking dish.
8. Whisk together the eggs with the milk, seasoning and parsley.
9. Divide the sausage and bacon mixture evenly around the bread.
10. Pour over the egg mixture until all the bread is covered.
11. Sprinkle with the cheese.
12. Cook for about 25 minutes until puffed up and golden.

## Notes
- I would coasely dice up and throw in some black pudding because it's **the best breafast component**.
- Potatoes, any form:
    1. My default would be something refined and elegant, a few [Birds Eye Potato Waffles](https://www.birdseye.co.uk/range/potato-waffles/potato-waffles/10-the-original-potato-waffles-567g). [Easy option](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSq_Fhcckvo) because they can just be wanged into the oven with the B&BP.
    2. Potato scones would be top tier but require marginally more attention than just being wanged into the oven. I suppose you could just oven cook them too.
    3. Rosti / hash brown?
    4. Home fries, small roasties, [Nigella's gnocchi roastini (stupid name, excellent time saver.)](https://www.myfussyeater.com/nigellas-rapid-roastini-fried-gnocchi/#tasty-recipes-8586) 
- I would either toss some whole plum tomatoes into the dish, or heat through separately in a pot to add some extra moisture.
- Beans. [Home made Boston Baked Beans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/bostonbakedbeans_10471) if you have the foresight/time, or whatever you have in the cupboard. I think Polish Fasolka would probably be sacrilege but also work really well here. You can buy from Tesco, Ebay or Amazon but I'd go to the local Polish shop or try an [smaller online vendor.](https://www.polishdelicatessen.co.uk/sklep/pamapol-fasolka-po-bretonsku-z-boczkiem-500g/)
