## Overview
The blurb straight from Bon Appetite states:

> Our better-than-ever broccoli cheddar soup recipe is lighter and brighter than some you may have had in the past. It boasts a creaminess that comes from blended potatoes and broccoli stalks rather than heavy cream or the roux that many recipes call for—which means that, minus the optional garnish, this creamy soup is also gluten-free. Grating a block of sharp cheddar is crucial for this comfort food classic as the preshredded stuff is often mixed with an anti-caking agent that can wreak havoc with the silky texture of this delicious soup.

> The other main player in broccoli cheese soup is, of course, the green stuff. The broccoli florets play two roles in this recipe: Half are added to the puréed base lending it a verdant hue, while the rest are mixed in toward the end, offering a nice crunch to break up the richness. Finally, in a nod to crusty bread bowls, we’ve added cheddar-topped croutons to every serving.

## Ingredients
- 2 onions
- 4 garlic cloves
- 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 heads of broccoli
- 1 medium russet potato
- 230g sharp cheddar cheese
- 4 thick slices rustic white bread, optional
- 140ml cup plain Greek yogurt

## Method
1. Halve 2 onions. Peel and coarsely chop. Peel and smash 4 garlic cloves, then coarsely chop. No need to break out your best knife skills because it’s all going to get blended, but try to cut everything into somewhat even pieces so they cook at the same rate.

2. Melt 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and ½ tsp. red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper. Stir to combine, then cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, trim bottoms of 2 heads of broccoli, then peel. Separate hefty stalks from florets (the thin, little stalks attached to broccoli tops are fine to leave attached to the crowns). Set aside florets. Coarsely chop stalks into 1"–2" pieces. Peel 1 medium russet potato. Coarsely chop into 1"–2" pieces.

4. Add broccoli stalks and potato pieces to pot and stir to coat in butter. Pour in 1.4L (5 cups) water, add 1 Tbsp. salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep at a simmer. Cover pot and cook until broccoli stalks and potatoes are completely tender (test with a cake tester, paring knife, or fork), 20–25 minutes.

5. Meanwhile, chop reserved florets into small pieces (you can take the time to separate them into baby florets or just have at them with your chef’s knife). Grate the strong cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box grater.

6. Add half of florets to pot, cover, and cook until bright green, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a blender, let cool for 5 minutes, and purée until smooth. Some blender advice: Don't fill your blender more than halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center lid from the blender and cover with a kitchen towel. Alternatively, use an immersion blender. Your soup won’t be quite as smooth, but it will still be great. Return purée to pot.

7. Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot and cook until bright green, another 3–5 minutes. Add 80% of the grated cheddar cheese and stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to low; set aside while you make the cheddar croutons.

8. Heat your grill. Grill 4 thick slices rustic white bread (if using) on a rimmed baking sheet until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread over (soft side up), then sprinkle with reserved cheddar cheese and a few flecks of red pepper flakes. Continue to grill until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 2–3 more minutes.

9. Remove soup from heat and stir in the plain Greek yogurt. Season generously with black pepper; taste for salt.

10. Cut cheese toasts (if using) into 1" (spoon-sized!) pieces. Divide soup among bowls. Top with cheddar croutons or reserved cheese.

## Notes
I would consider adding a punnet of chestnut mushrooms. Wiped clean, quartered and sweated in butter in batches until golden nutty brown. Wnstead of, or in addition to,  the cruton.
